#+TITLE: Loopback Firmware

** Loopback firmware for the Enclustra ZX3 on an EB1 baseboard.
- Loopback data frequency can be changed by adjusting the clock wizard clock 1
  output frequency.
  + Clock output #2 should remain at 200 MHz
- Loopback data can be checked by looking at the VIO through the Xilinx hardware
  manager
  - It is checked with an auto-synchronizing PRBS-7
  - The hardware manager also provides a ~reset~ control to reset the data counters.
  - The hardware manager also provides two ~tap delay~ controls to change the data
    and clock input delay in increments of 78 ps (setting from 0-31). This can
    be used to adjust for skew between clock and data.
    + A TCL script is provided to scan these values in the hardware manager
- Round trip latency can be measured by setting the generator to ~latency_mode~ in the vio
  + This will create a single clock wide pulse every 512 clocks; looking at the
    ILA allows for measurement of the round trip time
