#+TITLE: Loopback Firmware

** Loopback firmware for the Enclustra ZX3 on an EB1 baseboard.
- Loopback data frequency can be changed by adjusting the clock wizard clock 1
  output frequency.
- Loopback data can be checked by looking at the VIO through the Xilinx hardware
  manager
  - It is checked with an auto-synchronizing PRBS-7
  - The hardware manager also provides a ~reset~ control to reset the data counters.
  - The hardware manager also provides two ~tap delay~ controls to change the data
    and clock input delay in increments of 78 ps (setting from 0-31). This can
    be used to adjust for skew between clock and data.
